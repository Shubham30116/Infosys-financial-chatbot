# How It Works

1. Documents are loaded from PDFs, Excel, and CSV files
2. Text is split into smaller chunks
3. Embeddings are generated using Gemini Embeddings
4. FAISS stores document vectors locally
5. Relevant chunks are retrieved based on user queries
6. Gemini generates final responses using retrieved context
